# Welcome to ReCharge Theme Engine docs

## The widget

The Subscription Widget is the first point of contact many of your customers will encounter ReCharge. The challenge for the widget is getting it to function against an endless sea of variables, including theme types, browser versions, and plugins.

We've built the widget to look as good as possible on as many different configurations, but we still allow an wide amount of customizability and ways to override options in case the installation doesn't go as expected.
